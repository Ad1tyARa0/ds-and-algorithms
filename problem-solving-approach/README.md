# Problem solving approach.

    - Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    - What are the outputs that should come from the solution of the problem?
    - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? a.e do i have enoguh information to solve the problem?
    - How should I labal the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?
